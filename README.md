2. Put and extract the downloaded zip inside. 
3. Do `[WindowsButton] + R`, type `Shell:StartUp`, hit enter. A folder will open.
4. Put the shortcut file of `DRC Creative.vbs` from the extracted zip inside this folder(Now the app will start on pc start)
5. If you want to run it now, double click the shortcut

##How to use:

When it's running, you'll notice a new icon appear on your Taskbar. If you want to exclude the **currently open project** from showing up, click on the icon and click on `Don't show current project`.
